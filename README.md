# Movie-IMDB


A movie IMDb project involves creating a website or application that allows users to search for and access information about movies, including details like cast, crew, ratings, reviews, and more. Users can also rate and review movies, create watchlists, and explore various movie-related features. The project typically requires integrating with the IMDb API or using a database of movie information, along with a user-friendly interface for a seamless user experience.
